/// A fake implementation of [HttpClientRequest].
///
/// It is not necessary to use this class directly. Instead, code should be
/// written as if it is dealing with a regular [HttpHeaders].
///
/// See also:
///
///   * [HttpClientRequest]

/// HTTP request for a client connection.
///
/// To set up a request, set the headers using the headers property
/// provided in this class and write the data to the body of the request.
/// `HttpClientRequest` is an [IOSink]. Use the methods from IOSink,
/// such as `writeCharCode()`, to write the body of the HTTP
/// request. When one of the IOSink methods is used for the first
/// time, the request header is sent. Calling any methods that
/// change the header after it is sent throws an exception.
///
/// When writing string data through the [IOSink] the
/// encoding used is determined from the "charset" parameter of
/// the "Content-Type" header.
///
/// ```dart import:convert
/// var client = HttpClient();
/// HttpClientRequest request = await client.get('localhost', 80, '/file.txt');
/// request.headers.contentType =
///     ContentType('application', 'json', charset: 'utf-8');
/// request.write('text contentüëçüéØ'); // Strings written will be UTF-8 encoded.
/// ```
///
/// If no charset is provided the default of ISO-8859-1 (Latin 1) is used.
///
/// ```dart
/// var client = HttpClient();
/// HttpClientRequest request = await client.get('localhost', 80, '/file.txt');
/// request.headers.add(HttpHeaders.contentTypeHeader, "text/plain");
/// request.write('bl√•b√¶rgr√∏d'); // Strings written will be ISO-8859-1 encoded
/// ```
///
/// An exception is thrown if you use an unsupported encoding and the
/// `write()` method being used takes a string parameter.

  /// for "POST" requests with the method changed to "GET" when
  /// following the redirect.
  ///
  /// All headers added to the request will be added to the redirection
  /// request(s) except when forwarding sensitive headers like
  /// "Authorization", "WWW-Authenticate", and "Cookie". Those headers
  /// will be skipped if following a redirect to a domain that is not a
  /// subdomain match or exact match of the initial domain.
  /// For example, a redirect from "foo.com" to either "foo.com" or
  /// "sub.foo.com" will forward the sensitive headers, but a redirect to
  /// "bar.com" will not.

  /// var request = await client.getUrl(uri);
  /// request.followRedirects = false;
  /// var response = await request.close();

  ///     uri = uri.resolve(location);
  ///     request = await client.getUrl(uri);

  ///     response = await request.close();
  ///   }
  /// }
